# Machine Learning Projects

I have a background in machine learning with several Kaggle projects. To solidify my knowledge and get certified, I'm restudying through a Udemy course by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. This repository documents my course journey, including projects and exercises.

## Course Details

- **Course Name**: [Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)
- **Instructors**: Kirill Eremenko (DS & AI Instructor) and Hadelin de Ponteves (Passionate AI Instructor)

## Progress

- **Completed Modules**:
  - Regression
  - [Upcoming: Classification, Clustering, Association Rule Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Dimensionality Reduction, Model Selection & Boosting]

## Projects

### Regression
- **Project 1**: Predicting Energy Output
  - **Description**: Applied regression techniques to predict energy output using ambient temperature, vacuum, ambient pressure, and humidity.
  - **Methods**: Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
  - **Results**: Achieved a significant R² score, indicating a strong model performance.

### Kaggle Projects
- **Project 1**: Disease Prediction
  - **Dataset**: [Kaggle Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/input/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning/Training.csv)
  - **Description**: Used various machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms.
  - **Methods**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM
  - **Results**: Achieved high accuracy in disease prediction using optimized models.

- **Project 2**: Red Wine Quality Prediction
  - **Dataset**: [Kaggle Red Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/input/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/winequality-red.csv)
  - **Description**: Predicted the quality of red wine based on physicochemical properties.
  - **Methods**: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
  - **Results**: Improved model accuracy through feature engineering and model tuning.

### Classification
